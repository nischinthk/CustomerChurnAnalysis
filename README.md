üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates a binary classification pipeline using Python and multiple machine learning models.
The workflow includes:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Handling class imbalance with SMOTE

Model training & evaluation using:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Dimensionality reduction with PCA

Performance visualization

üìÇ Dataset
File: binary_classification_data2.csv

The dataset contains multiple features and a target column Churn.

The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (Yes/No).

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, SVC, PCA, SMOTE)

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE for class balancing)
